Features for me:
? Trigger display of drop-down listview via a timer (not sure I actually want this behavior)
x Make app a basic system tray app: no taskbar button
x Make app hide when Esc pressed (not exit)
x Show app via hotkey
    - Always make app appear in center of screen (even if previously moved)
- Add learning to scoring algorithm

    - Safely (only reindex when the app is not visible)
- Use proper layout for main window (no more absolute coordinates)
- Add location to list display
- Triggered reindexing?
- Underline matched letters

- Make background translucent
- Configurable colors / font / layout
