Features for me:
? Trigger display of drop-down listview via a timer (not sure I actually want this behavior)
x Launch selected item
    x Hide Canaveral when launching
        - Can we show a progress indicator to indicate we're launching? Can we even determine when the launch has finished?

x Make app hide when Esc pressed (not exit)
x Show app via hotkey
    x Always make app appear in center of screen (even if previously moved)

x Reindex on a timer
    - Safely (only reindex when the app is not visible)

    - Default entry point uses pythonw.exe
    - Optional entry point for running w/ python.exe
- Use pipx to install it

- Use proper layout for main window (no more absolute coordinates)
- Prevent text field from clipping vertically
- Draw background procedurally
- Make background translucent
- Add location to list display (tooltip easiest first?)
- Triggered reindexing?
